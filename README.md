# CyberVets_ePortfolio
Welcome to my CyberVets ePortfolio!
I am a military medic, with degrees in Biology and Nursing, making a career transition to the Cybersecurity industry. For 4 years, I served as a Program Administrator in one of the largest military treatment facilities in the National Capital Region. This ePortfolio is a window to my CyberVets journey. The CyberVets program is a rotation at Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) where service members engage in both authentic problem-based and “on the job” cybersecurity training, learning the skills required to protect our data and network.  The program begins with a solid foundation in networking fundamentals and network security essentials; and then progresses into more advanced areas such as reverse engineering, threat management, policy, and compliance management.
