# Welcome to my Cybervets ePortfolio!

Hello! My name is Arlene and I am a CMS CyberVets intern. This ePortfolio is a window to my CyberVets journey. The CyberVets program is a rotation at Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) where we engage in both authentic problem-based and “on the job” cybersecurity training, learning the skills required for data and network security. The program begins with a solid foundation in networking fundamentals and network security essentials; and then progresses into more advanced areas such as reverse engineering, threat management, policy, and compliance management.

## Wiki

This is my [home page](https://github.com/apinste/CyberVets_ePortfolio/wiki) where you can view links to my:
* [Resume](https://github.com/apinste/CyberVets_ePortfolio/wiki/Resume) 
* [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arlene-pinpin-stevens/) <img align="right" src="https://github.com/apinste/CyberVets_ePortfolio/blob/main/wiki_images/drop%20down%20pages.png" width="25%">
* [Projects](https://github.com/apinste/CyberVets_ePortfolio/projects?type=beta) 

On the right side bar, you can view the drop down menu for "Pages" to select a subtopic on my self introduction and my resume. No need to scroll through a long page. You can easily navigate the sections through this feature.

## Projects

The [Projects](https://github.com/apinste/CyberVets_ePortfolio/projects?type=beta) are divided in 4 categories namely:
* [Achievements](https://github.com/users/apinste/projects/6) - This is my CyberVets ‘brag board’ that includes the following and more: Leaderboard status, Competitions participated in, Challenges participated in, External presentations and/or publication.
* [Credentials](https://github.com/users/apinste/projects/5) - I will use this section to record all the credentials that I earn during the CMS CyberVets Program. I will also include current credentials related to Cybersecurity and leadership.
* [Civilian Workplace Competencies](https://github.com/users/apinste/projects/7) - CyberVets is unique in that it include soft skills embedded into its core content design and reinforced in specialized seminars. Competencies are drawn from the NIST NICE Workforce Competencies. Here's where I will document events attended and lessons learned.
* [Technical Skills](https://github.com/users/apinste/projects/8) - Here are key takeaways from each course. More details about Escalate Challenges are posted on the [Discussions Page](https://github.com/apinste/CyberVets_ePortfolio/discussions) to allow interaction with others and help me improve my strategies.

I am using the Beta version of Projects on Github. I set the view to "Board" so that I am able to move the entries like that in a Kanban board. The word Kanban is derived from a Japanese word that means "visual signal." This is a perfect tool for the CyberVets team, and all others who are interested in my work, to stay-up-to date with my projects, competencies, credentials, and achievements.

If you are up for a discussion about Escalate Missions or just interested to get a sneak peak of one of the exciting things we do in CyberVets, visit the [Discussions Page](https://github.com/apinste/CyberVets_ePortfolio/discussions). What is [Escalate](https://escalate.today/)? It is a gamified cybersecurity ecosystem developed and utilized by DoD and intelligence personnel. Each Escalate mission allows us to hack through real-life scenarios with a community of professionals and mentors.
