# APINSTE
Welcome to my CyberVets ePortfolio!

I am a military medic, finishing my graduate degree in Cybersecurity Management and Policy at UMGC to fulfill my vision of being a part of the Cybersecurity industry. I have a robust background in education, training, and healthcare with degrees in Biology and Nursing as well as a diploma in Primary Montessori Education. This ePortfolio is a window to my CyberVets journey. The CyberVets program is a rotation at Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) where we engage in both authentic problem-based and “on the job” cybersecurity training, learning the skills required for data and network security. The program begins with a solid foundation in networking fundamentals and network security essentials; and then progresses into more advanced areas such as reverse engineering, threat management, policy, and compliance management.
